#  CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING
Developed a machine learning model using Python and Scikit-learn to forecast customer attrition. The model enabling the  
identification of at-risk customers and the implementation of targeted retention strategies for a Telco company.  
The solution is deployed as a user-friendly interface where users can simply enter input into the required fields and click on  
the "Predict Churn" button.  
The interactive visual dashboard is also design to help businesses monitor, analyse, and predict customer churn. It provides a  
comprehensive overview of customer retention patterns, factors influencing churn, and potential areas for improvement.  
The dashboard typically aggregates key metrics and insights into an interactive, easy-to-navigate interface, enabling  
decision-makers in the telecom industries to quickly understand churn dynamics and take proactive actions to retain  
customers, optimize services, and improve overall customer satisfaction.  
•	Analysed and processed Telco historical dataset using exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
•	Built classification models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest)  
•	Evaluate the model performance using Cross-validation with a focus on accuracy and F1 score.  
•	Achieved an optimal performance accuracy of 80% using Random Forest after optimizing hyperparameters.
